The openid extension is meant to allow users to sign-in using an OpenID or through their Google, FaceBook or Twitter account.

This extension differs from the version by Bruce Morrison:
- It is implemented as a login handler, in order to avoid code duplication. However, this does require several kernel changes to user/login;
- In addition to OpenID it also has RPX implemented (https://rpxnow.com/);
- It uses an updated version of the OpenID for PHP code library;
- This version has been implemented without the automatic creation of user accounts. 
We implement this functionality only on demand: please contact info@contactivity.com for more information about professional support.
